        <p class="s20-text">In the early 1920s, silent films took center stage with famous pioneers like Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton. The films developed stories and characters that transcended language barriers and therefore conveyed narrative and emotion visually.
          The silent film era ended in the late 1920s, when synchronized sound was introduced, and sound films or “talkies” were born. The newest invention opened new possibilities for storytelling.

        <p class="s30-40-text">This was the period when Hollywood was at the height of its golden age and dominated the film industry. It was during this time that many classic films were released, and many movie stars were at their peak, such as Marilyn Monroe, Audrey Hepburn, Cary Grant, and Humphrey Bogart. The development of film genres such as film noir and musicals were also a product of this period.
          Films during the Great Depression and World War II provided escapism for audiences, it would give people something to feel good about and help people forget their troubles. The Golden Age also corresponds with a period after the Great Depression in which the US was booming economically. People flocked to Hollywood to become actors or actresses and the influx resulted in a larger number of high-quality films being made, making this period successful in terms of filmmaking.

        <h1 class="new-hollywood">New Hollywood</h1>
        <p class="s70-text">The 1970s became a creative high point in the film industry. It was the start of the mindset of film as art and marked a period of artistic and cultural revolution in cinema. The restrictions had loosened up, and the hippie movement, the civil rights movement, free love, rock ‘n’ roll, changing gender roles, and drug use certainly had an impact. New Hollywood, a movement where a new generation of young filmmakers came to prominence, came to rise during this time.
          Directors like Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola, and Steven Spielberg were significant during this period with films like “Taxi Driver” (1976), “The Godfather” trilogy, and “Jaws” (1975). These films pushed the boundaries of storytelling, tackling complex themes and pushing the limits of technical innovation.
