        <!-- <h1 class="new-hollywood">New Hollywood</h1> -->
        <p class="hollywood-text">The 1970s became a creative high point in the film industry. It was the start of the mindset of film as art and marked a period of artistic and cultural revolution in cinema. The restrictions had loosened up, and the hippie movement, the civil rights movement, free love, rock ‘n’ roll, changing gender roles, and drug use certainly had an impact. New Hollywood, a movement where a new generation of young filmmakers came to prominence, came to rise during this time.
          Directors like Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola, and Steven Spielberg were significant during this period with films like “Taxi Driver” (1976), “The Godfather” trilogy, and “Jaws” (1975). These films pushed the boundaries of storytelling, tackling complex themes and pushing the limits of technical innovation.

        <p class="s80-text">The 1980s were characterized by the introduction of “high-concept” films – they had short cinematic plots that could be summarized in one or two sentences. The films in the 80s were less experimental and original than the 70s, but more formulaic. New special effects (CGI) were introduced which films were eager to capitalize on.
          Directors like Steven Spielberg and George Lucas are associated with the 80s and some famous films are “E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial” (1982), “Back to the Future” (1985), “Ghostbusters” (1984), and “Indiana Jones”.
